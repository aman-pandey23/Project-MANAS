3R planar arm project

Python Version 3 / any version of cpp needs to be installed to run the code files (.c / .py) 
Python version of code needs matplotlib to be installed in order to show the plots of the arm


Inputs taken:
xe : x coordinate value for point to be reached by arm
xe : y coordinate value for point to be reached by arm
phie : degree value of sum of theta angles (orientation variable)
l1, l2, l3 length values of the arms

Output:
Theta values of each arm
theta1, theta2, theta3
(Python version only) : matplotlib plot of the arms and coordinates
